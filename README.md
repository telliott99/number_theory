#### Basic Number Theory

#### Note on LaTeX

The files in this project are LaTeX files.  They can be typset individually to pdf (provided the graphics files are discovered), or the whole thing can be converted to one giant pdf.  To do this I run ``script.sh``, but to do this yourself, you will not only need a LaTeX distribution, you must also edit the hard coded paths.
