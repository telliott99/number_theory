Extended EA in code

We want to find multiplicative inverses, and to do that we will use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

First, here is a brute-force method which manually checks the remainder for every ``n`` until it finds one.

If the inverse does not exist, this function will never return.

.. code-block:: python

    # requires a > b
    def caveman(m,p):
        n = 2
        while m*n % p != 1:
            n += 1
        return n

The inverse  exists if and only if the greatest common divisor is ``1``.  In the case of arithmetic ``% 60``, the integer ``6`` does *not* have a multiplicative inverse.  That's because

.. code-block:: python

    (6 * i) % 60

cannot be equal to ``1``.  For mod ``60`` only the following numbers have inverses (as shown):

::

     7 43
    11 11
    13 37
    17 53
    19 19
    23 47
    29 29
    31 31
    37 13
    41 41
    43 7
    47 23
    49 49
    53 17
    59 59

If you're thinking these are all primes, you're right.  Another way to state the problem with ``6`` and ``60`` is that their gcd is not equal to ``1``:  they have the common factor ``6`` or prime factors ``2`` and ``3``.

Extended EA recap
-----------------

In the previous chapter, we went through two methods for using the information from a run of the EA to compute the multiplicative inverse of a number mod `a`, the larger number input to the EA algorithm.  

I call these the "forward" and "backward" methods.  

The backward method runs the EA to completion first, then processes the data in reverse order.  I found it relatively easy to code this one.

-------------
Backward code
-------------

With data from a run for ``a = 231`` and ``b = 130``:

.. code-block:: python

    101 = 231 - (1) * 130
     29 = 130 - (1) * 101
     14 = 101 - (3) * 29
      1 =  29 - (2) * 14
      0 =  14 - (1) * 14

Consider this step:

.. code-block:: python

    1 = 29 + (-2) * 14    
    1 = 29 + (-2) * [101 - (3) * 29]
    1 = (-2) * 101 + (7) * 29

We need two variables, call them ``x`` and ``y``.

The data from the previous round is ``x = 1`` (the coefficient of ``29``), and ``y = -2`` (the coefficient of ``14``).

For the update, we need the new value of ``q``, the quotient in the equation ``q(b) = (3) * 29``.

The new values of ``x`` and ``y`` are:

.. code-block:: python

    x = y
    y = x - y * q
    
where ``x`` in the second equation is the old value.  We need a temporary variable to hold this value.

Here is the code for the inner loop from my version:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(2,N):
        a,b,q,r = L.pop(0)
        tmp = x
        x = y
        y = tmp - q * y
        t = a,b,q,r,x,y
        pp(t)   # pretty print

For the first step, the equation is:

.. code-block:: python

    1 =  29 - (2) * 14

so the values we need for ``x`` and ``y`` are:

.. code-block:: python

    x = 1
    y = -q

Here is a run with some numbers I picked out of thin air:

.. code-block:: bash

    > python eea.py 333337 58498
    a=16,b=3,q=5,r=1,x=1,y=-5
    a=35,b=16,q=2,r=3,x=-5,y=11
    a=86,b=35,q=2,r=16,x=11,y=-27
    a=465,b=86,q=5,r=35,x=-27,y=146
    a=1016,b=465,q=2,r=86,x=146,y=-319
    a=5545,b=1016,q=5,r=465,x=-319,y=1741
    a=17651,b=5545,q=3,r=1016,x=1741,y=-5542
    a=40847,b=17651,q=2,r=5545,x=-5542,y=12825
    a=58498,b=40847,q=1,r=17651,x=12825,y=-18367
    a=333337,b=58498,q=5,r=40847,x=-18367,y=104660
    multiplicative inverse of 58498 is 104660 mod 333337
    > 

Check it:

>>> 58498 * 104660 % 333337

I found some code [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Mathematics/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm)

.. code-block:: python

    # return (g, x, y) a*x + b*y = gcd(x, y)
    def egcd(a, b):
        if a == 0:
            return (b, 0, 1)
        else:
            g, x, y = egcd(b % a, a)
            return (g, y - (b // a) * x, x)

What this recursive version does in effect is the backward algorithm.  It recursively calls itself, then builds up the result through all the returns.

It's a bit confusing because the values of ``b`` and ``a`` are switched compared to my usage:  it does ``b % a``.  ``x`` and ``y`` are also switched.

The lines

.. code-block:: python

    g, x, y = egcd(b % a, a)
    return (g, y - (b // a) * x, x)

carry out the computation, assigning ``x`` for ``y``, and ``y - q*x`` for ``x``, in the ``return`` line.

------------
Forward code
------------

The run for ``a = 231`` and ``b = 130`` had this data:

.. code-block:: python

    101 = 231 - (1 * 130
     29 = 130 - (1) * 101
     14 = 101 - (3) * 29
      1 =  29 - (2) * 14
      0 =  14 - (1) * 14

and these steps:

.. code-block:: python

    101 = 231 - (1) * 130 
        = a - b

    29 = 130 - (1) * 101
       = b - (1) * (a - b)
       = (-1 * a + 2 * b

    14 = 101 - (3) * 29
       = (a - b) - (3)[(-1) * a + (2) * b]
       = 4 * a - 7 * b

    1 = 29 + (-2) * 14
      = (-1) * a + (2) * b - (2) * [(4) * a - (7) * b]
      = (-9) * a + (16) * b

After noodling around for a bit, here is the pseudocode I came up with.  We need to retain values from two rounds back, stored in the variables ``s`` and ``t``.

::

    round -1
    s = 0
    t = 1
    
    round 0
    q = 1
    x = 1
    y = -q = -1
    
    round 1
    q = 1
    tmp = x,y = 1,-1
    x = s - q*x = 0 - 1 = -1
    y = t - q*y = 1 - (1)-1 = 2
    s, t = tmp = 1,-1
    
    round 2
    q = 3
    tmp = x,y = -1,2
    x = s - q*x = 1 - 3(-1) = 4
    y = t - q*y = -1 - (3)2 = -7
    s, t = tmp = -1,2
    
    round 3
    q = 2
    tmp = x,y = 4,-7
    x = s - q*x = -1 - 2(4) = -9
    y = t - q*y = 2 - (2)(-7) = 16
    s, t = tmp = 4,-7
    
    y is the inverse

This is the inner loop:

.. code-block:: python

while r != 0:
    a,b = b,r
    q = a / b
    r = a % b
    tmp = x,y
    x = s - q*x
    y = t - q*y
    s,t = tmp
    print 'x',x,'y',y,'s',s,'t',t

[eea_forward.py](scripts/eea_forward.py)

.. code-block:: bash

    > python eea_forward.py 231 130
        x 1 y -1
        x -1 y 2 s 1 t -1
        x 4 y -7 s -1 t 2
        x -9 y 16 s 4 t -7
        x 130 y -231 s -9 t 16
        16 is the inverse of 130 mod 231
    >

Check it


>>> 16 * 130 % 231
1
>>>

Here is code from the web to carry out the forward method.  I haven't figured out how it works yet.

.. code-block:: python

    def eea(a,b):
        s, t = 1, 0
        u, v = 0, 1
        while b != 0:
            q = a / b
            a, b = b, a % b
            
            tmp = s, t
            s = u - (q * s)
            t = v - (q * t)
            (u,v) = tmp
        return u
    
    print eea(53,10)

This is very similar to what I had, except that ``u,v`` plays the role of ``s,t``, and ``s,t`` plays the role of ``x,y``.
